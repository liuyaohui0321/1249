This value is only updated after a packet is successfully received, and therefore can be used to determine if a receive packet is ready to be processed when a non-0 value is read.
If the number of packets received is one, then this register returns the value of the locations occupied. After the FIFO is read, any subsequent read to this register returns the value of 0. If more than one packet is received, a read to this register returns the number of locations occupied by the latest received packet
